NUIT DU CODE - 2023 - Tanks on Ice
Valentin Huber, Samuel Minonne, Nolhan Brulé

I - Our idea

We decided to pick the “Le dernier à l\'écran gagne” theme and make our own graphics.
We created a game where two players play against each other, using the same keyboard. They are going to drive tanks on ice, and their goal is going to be to eject the enemy tank from the ice, or to reduce its HP from 10 to 0.

The drivers will have to choose between two drive modes. One is an axial mode, and enables the drivers to go any direction. The other is a rotational mode, with the possibility to turn by 45 degrees, and to shoot while going backward.

II - Controls
To choose your drive mode, it is possible to click on the yellow button. To launch the game, click on the button “Play”.

The red tank uses the numpad with the keys “8” and “5” to go forward and backwards, and the keys “4” and “6” to turn, “0” to shoot.
The green one uses the keys z, q, s and d in the same pattern, space to shoot.

The axial drive uses the keys “z”,”q”, “s”, “d” and “8”,”4”,”5”, “6”, too, as well as the keys 7,9,3 and 1 to go diagonally with the numpad, and “a”,”e”,”c” and “w” with the other side of the keyboard.

At the end of the game, it is possible to replay by pressing “r”
